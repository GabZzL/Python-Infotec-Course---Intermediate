1. Inheritance	
"Is-a"	
Creating a new class (child/subclass) that takes on the features (methods and attributes) of an existing class (parent/superclass).	
Reuse existing code; defines a hierarchy.	
None (Child depends on Parent's structure, but objects are independent).

2. Aggregation	
"Has-a" (Weak)	
A class contains a reference to another object, but that object can exist independently of the container. Sharing objects is possible.	
Weak (If the container is destroyed, the contained object remains).

3. Composition	
"Has-a" (Strong)	
A class owns and manages the lifecycle of its contained object. The contained object cannot exist meaningfully without the container.	
Defines internal parts of the whole.	
Strong (If the container is destroyed, the contained object is destroyed or becomes irrelevant).
